# Shell-Script
This shell script checks all the directories in the logs folder.

## Read the Question Script first to understand what this script was written for and how each of the check works.

## 1st Check
Checks if the file name has a valid date. If not then it was tempered by the hacker.

## 2nd Check
Checks if the file name has a valid leap date. If not then it was tempered by the hacker.

## 3rd Check
Compares if the file directory name & date matches the department and date inside each of the files. If not then it was tempered by the hacker.

# Remember the way I solved this is not the only method. You can do it in your way, this is just to show you how I tackled the question with my understanding.

## Hope this helps out all the students who are learning Operating Systems
I, myself as a undergraduate student had a hard time making the code work, so I want make it a little bit easier for others to find the guidelines to write good shell scripts. More importantly understand how we should approach the task.
